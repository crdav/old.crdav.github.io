Craster is a fishing village in Northumberland, with a small harbour and a fantastic pub in the Jolly Fisherman. From Craster, there’s a walk of about a mile or so through fields up to Dunstanburgh Castle.
The castle is in ruins, and accessible to the public and is managed jointly by English Heritage and the National Trust.
