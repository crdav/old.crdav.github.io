# Huel Ready to Drink (RTD) Review - January 2020

## Background
I’ve used (drank? eaten? consumed?) Huel before. The first time I discovered it was during my final year of university, when I tried out version 1.2 of the powder. I found it far too chalky and despite my best efforts I never could shake it enough to get rid of the lumps. I gave up on it at this point, regretting that I wasn’t able to make something useful work well for me.

More recently, I gave it another go with the v2.3 powder during winter 2018/19. I was working a relatively intensive medical on-call rota, where I would frequently be working busy twilight shifts, long weekend days or nightshifts. On all of these shifts (particularly the twilight shifts of 1300-2100) I found it tricky to fit in a proper meal. The nature of the shift meant that I would be called away to an emergency in the middle of heating up my food or I would have to wolf something down in between phonecalls, with a list of jobs building up. Either way, good nutrition wasn’t exactly easy.

At this point I bought some more Huel and, resolving to try and fix the issues I had with lumpiness before, a blender. This worked very well. Suddenly getting a good meal on tricky shifts was easier. I was eating less junk food on my nightshifts.

When I moved to a GP placement and my Huel ran out I didn’t buy another bag - as my hours were more normal, I didn’t feel the need to keep up with using Huel.

## Deciding to try Huel again
Why did I decide to try it again? Quite simply, I got sucked into the marketing bubble - some adverts on Instagram put some thoughts back in my head of giving it another go. Then at the beginning of the month I was in Sainsbury’s looking for some Kombucha to give that a go, as I’d wondered what it was like - and what was next to it? Some bottles of Huel Ready to Drink! And so began the re-experiment… I ordered 2 bags of powdered Huel (v3.0) and 2 boxes of Ready to Drink - 12 bottles of berry and 12 bottles of chocolate.

As it’s January, and this is a busy time for Huel (presumably a mix of there being a lot of people who are starting off the year with a health kick along with the Christmas slowdown in deliveries), not all of my order arrived in the usual 1 day Huel usually achieves. The powders have been delayed by a day, and my review of those will follow shortly.

## Huel Ready to Drink (RTD) - v1.0

My first try of RTD was the bottles I bought from Sainsbury’s. The two flavours available in store are Vanilla and Chocolate. These were priced at £3.50 per bottle in my local shop, but I would imagine price varies depending on location.

I’m not sure if all Sainsbury’s stores stock Huel RTD - but Huel’s website has a handy [store locator](https://uk.huel.com/pages/huel-store-locator) if you’d like to see which ones are near you.

### Flavours
#### Huel RTD Chocolate
This is the first one I tried. I had it for breakfast one morning, as I wasn’t really feeling a bowl of Weetabix (well, really Aldi’s [”Wheat Bisks”](https://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/asda-compare-prices/Breakfast_Cereals/Harvest_Morn_Wheat_Bisks_36_per_pack_675g.html)). I wanted a bit of a change, and reached for one of the two bottles I’d bought - naturally my hand went for chocolate over vanilla.

Honestly, I was impressed. Other than breakfast maybe not being _quite_ the optimal time to try what is essentially a chocolate milkshake, this tasted _good_. Gone were any concerns of lumps of Huel getting stuck in my teeth, this was a smooth drink. It essentially has the consistency of a thick milkshake drink - think a Frijj - but is obviously better for you than one of those. The chocolate flavour isn’t overly sweet nor is it overly bitter, at least to my palate. I’m sure there will be some who find it too sweet and others who find it too bitter, but for me it was perfect.

#### Huel RTD Vanilla

#### Huel RTD Berry

### Nutrition
All of the RTD bottles contain 400kcal - Huel’s definition of a meal. How those 400kcal come about in terms of macronutrients is slightly different from flavour to flavour - for example, the chocolate flavour has slightly less sugar and slightly more fat. The full breakdown of nutrition (including the vitamins/minerals contained in Huel RTD) can be found [here](https://uk.huel.com/pages/the-huel-ready-to-drink-formula-explained).

The essential takeaway is that Huel RTD, whilst having a slightly different split of macronutrients to the powder (less carb, less protein, more fat) is still what Huel term a “nutritionally complete meal in a bottle”. Basically, if you were to consume all of your calories from these bottles, you would meet (or exceed) your recommended daily requirements of vitamins and minerals.

### Satiety

### Price
Most important thing until last, eh?

Put simply, Huel Ready to Drink is not cheap. Not by any stretch of the imagination.

### Environmental impact
Another thing I have noticed from the bottles is that Huel RTD is produced in the USA, then shipped back to the UK before being sold here. This is in addition to being sold in a plastic bottle.

For a company who have a mission statement that states their goal is: “To make nutritionally complete, convenient, affordable food, with minimum impact on animals and the environment.”[^1] it seems like this goes against their ethos. I’ve seen it explained on their forums by Huel representatives that they feel that a plant-based diet reduces environmental impact and using plastic is sort of a necessary evil - the pros balance out the cons, if you will.[^2] 

Now, Huel do use recycled plastic - 25% of the bottle is made from this - with a plan to raise this to 65% by 2020 (so hopefully some news on this soon as it’s now 2020?). I understand why they have decided to use plastic bottles for convenience, and sort of buy into the arguments they make. They are also readily recycled, which is another plus. However, the product being shipped from the USA to the UK is just adding extra emissions. I hope they can produce it more locally in the future.
