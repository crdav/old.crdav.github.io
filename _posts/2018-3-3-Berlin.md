Berlin is a fascinating city with plenty of history behind it. It’s also a popular city break destination - although it is pretty cold in February!

## The Berlin Wall
By far the most impressive thing we visited in Berlin was the 1.3km stretch of the Berlin Wall that is in place today at the East Side Gallery. Home to many famous murals, this section of the Wall has been painted by numerous artists in a way that would not have been allowed when it was carrying out its original function of division between East and West. These two images are from the painted part of the Wall.

The shadow this section of the Wall casts over the pavement is quite striking as well, and must have added to the incredibly imposing presence of this dividing line of the city. Unfortunately I did not take any photos of the Wall that is near Topgographie des Terrors, but this is in a way even more imposing as there are no murals painted onto it and the Wall is in its original concrete form.

Near Checkpoint Charlie is this plaque of the GDR (DDR in German - Deutsche Demokratische Republik) - the communist state of the East.

## The Reichstag

The Reichstag is the seat of the Bundestag (German federal parliament). The plenary chamber sits underneath a modern dome, designed by British architect Norman Foster.
The dome is accessible by booking onto a free tour, either with a guide or a self-guided tour with an audioguide. I can highly recommend the tour, as the views over Berlin are fantastic, with the audioguide detailing the buildings you can see at different points.

These mirrors reflect light into the plenary chamber below, providing natural light.
At the very top of the dome, there is an opening to the atmosphere. This is both  practical, serving as ventilation to the chamber below (with a clever heat recovery system and precipitation collection system), as well as symbolic, providing a metaphor for open debate.

## Ampelmann

Originally an East German design, the Ampelmann (or more correctly Ampelmännchen) was designed by a traffic psychologist, Karl Peglau. They act as stop and go for pedestrians crossing Berlin’s roads. After Berlin was reunified, the Ampelmann design was removed in favour of the West German, more traditional, pedestrian crossing signs.
However, fortunately, there was a campaign to bring back the Ampelmann and now in Berlin a lot of the pedestrian crossings now have Ampelmann and his hat to guide you across!
There are 8 Ampelmann shops in Berlin selling a very wide range of souvenirs relating to the hat-wearing safety feature.
