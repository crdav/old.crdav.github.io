## Background
I’ve used (drank? eaten? consumed?) Huel before. The first time I discovered it was during my final year of university, when I tried out version 1.2 of the powder. I found it far too chalky and despite my best efforts I never could shake it enough to get rid of the lumps. I gave up on it at this point, regretting that I wasn’t able to make something useful work well for me.

More recently, I gave it another go with the v2.3 powder during winter 2018/19. I was working a relatively intense medical on-call rota, where I would frequently be working busy twilight shifts, long weekend days or night shifts. On all of these shifts (particularly the twilight shifts of 1300-2100) I found it tricky to fit in a proper meal. The nature of the shifts meant that I would be called away to an emergency in the middle of heating up my food or I would have to wolf something down in between phone calls, with a list of jobs building up. Either way, good nutrition wasn’t exactly easy.

At this point I bought some more Huel and, resolving to try and fix the issues I had with lumpiness before, a blender. This worked very well. Suddenly getting a good meal on tricky shifts was easier. I was eating less junk food on my night shifts. I wasn’t experiencing indigestion after quickly eating some food with a pager going off on my belt.

When I moved to a GP placement and my Huel ran out I didn’t buy another bag - as my hours were more normal, I didn’t feel the need to keep up with using Huel.

## Deciding to try Huel again
Why did I decide to try it again? Quite simply, I got sucked into the marketing bubble! Some adverts on Instagram put some thoughts back in my head of giving it another go. Then at the beginning of the month I was in Sainsbury’s looking for some Kombucha to give that a go, as I’d wondered what it was like - and what was next to it? Some bottles of Huel Ready to Drink! And so began the re-experiment… I ordered 2 bags of powdered Huel (v3.0) and 2 boxes of Ready to Drink - 12 bottles of berry and 12 bottles of chocolate.

As it’s January, and this is a busy time for Huel (presumably a mix of a lot of people starting off the year with a health kick and the Christmas slowdown in deliveries), not all of my order arrived in the usual 1 day Huel usually achieves. The powders I ordered were delayed by a day, and my review of those will follow shortly.

## Huel Ready to Drink (RTD) - v1.0
![Huel RTD Bottles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crdav/crdav.github.io/master/images/huel/Bottles.jpg)
My first try of RTD was the bottles I bought from Sainsbury’s. The two flavours available in store are Vanilla and Chocolate. These were priced at £3.50 per bottle in my local shop, but I would imagine price varies depending on location.

I’m not sure if all Sainsbury’s stores stock Huel RTD - but Huel’s website has a handy [store locator](https://uk.huel.com/pages/huel-store-locator) if you’d like to see which ones are near you.

### Flavours
#### Huel RTD Chocolate
> It has the consistency of a semi-thick milkshake drink - think a Frijj

Chocolate flavour is the first one I tried. I had it for breakfast one morning, as I wasn’t really feeling a bowl of Weetabix (well, really Aldi’s [”Wheat Bisks”](https://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/asda-compare-prices/Breakfast_Cereals/Harvest_Morn_Wheat_Bisks_36_per_pack_675g.html)). I wanted a bit of a change, and reached for one of the two bottles I’d bought - naturally my hand went for chocolate over vanilla.

Honestly, I was impressed. Other than breakfast maybe not being _quite_ the optimal time to try what is essentially a chocolate milkshake, this tasted **good**. Gone were any concerns of lumps of Huel getting stuck in my teeth, this was a smooth drink. It essentially has the consistency of a semi-thick milkshake drink - think a Frijj - but is obviously better for you than one of those. The chocolate flavour isn’t overly sweet nor is it overly bitter, at least to my palate. I’m sure there will be some who find it too sweet and others who find it too bitter, but for me it was perfect.

#### Huel RTD Vanilla
I tried this second. It was the other bottle I bought off-the-shelf in Sainsbury’s.

The vanilla flavour is the one I’ve always had in the powdered form of Huel - it’s the classic. Again, I tried it for breakfast. It was slightly more grainy than the chocolate flavour. It was still a semi-thick milkshake consistency.

Taste was good, similar to the vanilla Huel flavour I’m used to from the powder - but maybe slightly sweeter. It’s been a while since I’ve had Huel powder though, so maybe my memory is failing me.

I didn’t order any bottles with my delivery - not because I didn’t like it (because I did, although I preferred the chocolate) - but rather because I was also ordering some vanilla powder, and wanted some variety. I definitely think I will try it again. As it is available in a shop rather than just online, it will be much easier to pick up a bottle of this flavour than…

#### Huel RTD Berry
Yep, this one is only available online. I took a bit of a risk ordering 12 bottles without trying it, but as my experiences were so positive with the others, thought it was worth a try. I normally love all things berry, and had read online that it has a stronger strawberry taste over the other berries. Great! That’s my favourite berry! 🍓 

This time I tried it for lunch, just for some variety. I was ready to face the Weetabix-alternatives again, and those joyless biscuits constituted my breakfast.

I have to say yet again I am impressed by the taste of the RTD bottles. Consistency is good as well, but the flavour is lovely. It’s going to be a hard choice between berry and chocolate for me when I fancy a bottle - fortunately I bought 12 of each!

### Nutrition
> A “nutritionally complete meal in a bottle”

All of the RTD bottles contain 400kcal - Huel’s definition of a meal. How those 400kcal come about in terms of macronutrients is slightly different from flavour to flavour - for example, the chocolate flavour has slightly less sugar and slightly more fat. The full breakdown of nutrition (including the vitamins/minerals contained in Huel RTD) can be found [here](https://uk.huel.com/pages/the-huel-ready-to-drink-formula-explained).

The essential takeaway is that Huel RTD, whilst having a slightly different split of macronutrients to the powder (less carb, less protein, more fat[^1]) is still what Huel term a “nutritionally complete meal in a bottle”. Basically, if you were to consume all of your calories from these bottles, you would meet (or exceed) your recommended daily requirements of vitamins and minerals.

### Satiety
In the past, I’ve found the feeling of satiety with Huel a bit mixed. Sometimes I’ve felt full until my next meal, sometimes I’ve had cravings for food. This time, with all 3 of the RTD bottles, I have felt full until around 30 minutes before I would normally eat my next meal. For me, this is entirely normal! So that’s another big tick in the positive column for these drinks.

### Price
> RTD is nearly double the price of the powder

Put simply, Huel Ready to Drink is not cheap. Not by any stretch of the imagination.

In Sainsbury’s, it’s £3.50 a bottle. That’s for 400kcal. Online, ordering 2 lots of 12 bottles (i.e. 2 boxes) on a “subscription” basis, it’s £2.51 a bottle.

In contrast, the powder costs £1.29/400kcal. So RTD is nearly double the price for the same number of calories if you’re buying the bottles/powders online - even more if buying it in store.

However, it all comes down to convenience. Sometimes, you just want to be able to grab a chilled bottle and go. I can also see the bottles being useful for people who would normally buy a meal-deal lunch for £2-4 - picking up a Huel RTD bottle instead and having a more nutritious meal would hopefully be tempting.

### Environmental impact
Another thing I have noticed from the bottles is that Huel RTD is produced in the USA, then shipped back to the UK before being sold here. This is in addition to being sold in a plastic bottle.

For a company who have a mission statement that states their goal is: _“To make nutritionally complete, convenient, affordable food, with minimum impact on animals and the environment.”_[^2] it seems like this goes against their ethos. I’ve seen it explained on their forums by Huel representatives that they feel that a plant-based diet reduces environmental impact and using plastic is sort of a necessary evil - the pros balance out the cons, if you will.[^3] 

Now, Huel do use recycled plastic - 25% of the bottle is made from this - with a plan to raise this to 65% by 2020 (so hopefully some news on this soon as it’s now 2020). I understand why they have decided to use plastic bottles for convenience, and sort of buy into the arguments they make. They are also readily recycled, which is another plus. However, the product being shipped from the USA to the UK is just adding extra emissions. I hope they can produce it more locally in the future.

## Conclusion
Overall, Huel Ready to Drink has been a positive experience for me. I have enjoyed the taste of the different flavours (more so chocolate and berry than vanilla) and have found the bottles keep me feeling sated. As with my past experience of Huel, the nutritional consideration is also a bonus. 

My only issues with the RTD bottles are the price and the environmental impact the bottles have.

That said, I think I will continue to use these - possibly as a quick breakfast before or after cycling to work, or any other occasion when taking powder and a shaker is less convenient.

## £10 off your first order
Now it wouldn’t be a Huel review without this. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a review of Huel where someone doesn’t plug their referral code!

Basically, if you want to try Huel and spend £40 or more on an order, we both get £10 off! Sounds like a win-win to me. So [click here](https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/iz5qz-d27716f887) if that offer sounds tempting to you. If it doesn’t, then just order from their website as usual - there’s no obligation to use the link!
