One day after my [RTD bottles](/Huel-Ready-To-Drink-RTD-Review/) arrived, the powder followed. A smaller and lighter box (as expected) turned up, along with another helpful DPD delivery driver.

Now it wouldn’t be a Huel review without this. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a review of Huel where someone doesn’t plug their referral code!

Basically, if you want to try Huel and spend £40 or more on an order, we both get £10 off! Sounds like a win-win to me. So [click here](https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/iz5qz-d27716f887) if that offer sounds tempting to you. If it doesn’t, then just order from their website as usual - there’s no obligation to use the link!
