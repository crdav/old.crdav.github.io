Hi. I'm Chris, a GP Trainee in the North East of England with an interest in Formula 1, photography, technology, cycling and running.

You'll find some photos I've taken on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/crdav92) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/crdav92). I don't tweet much, but am also on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/crd92).
